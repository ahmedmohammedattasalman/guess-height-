# Height Estimation App - Task Log

## Project Initialization - [Date: Current Date]

1. Created project structure with necessary folders:
   - assets (images, icons, animations, ml_models)
   - lib (screens, components, models, services, utils, providers, constants)
   
2. Added required dependencies to pubspec.yaml:
   - Image handling: image_picker, image_cropper
   - State management: provider
   - UI components: flutter_svg, google_fonts, lottie
   - Storage: shared_preferences, path_provider, uuid
   - ML integration: tflite_flutter, camera

## Implementation - [Date: Current Date]

1. Created theme and constants files:
   - AppTheme: Modern color palette, text styles, and component themes
   - AppConstants: App-wide constants, routes, and string resources

2. Created model classes:
   - UserProfile: User information and saved estimations
   - HeightEstimation: Height estimation results and metadata
   - ReferenceObject: Reference object information for height calculation

3. Created provider classes:
   - UserProvider: User profile management and authentication
   - HeightEstimationProvider: Image processing and height estimation

4. Implemented main screens:
   - HomeScreen: Professional layout with quick access buttons
   - ImagePreviewScreen: Image adjustment and reference object selection
   - ResultsScreen: Detailed height estimation results with visual representation
   - ProfileScreen: User profile management
   - HistoryScreen: Past height estimations with details

5. Created reusable components:
   - GradientButton: Custom button with gradient background
   - FeatureCard: Card component for displaying features

6. Updated README.md with project information and instructions

## Next Steps

1. Add sample images for testing
2. Implement actual height estimation algorithm
3. Add user authentication with Firebase
4. Implement cloud storage for user data and images
5. Add more reference objects and improve accuracy
6. Implement ML-based object detection for automatic reference object identification
